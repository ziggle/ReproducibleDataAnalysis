# Reproducible Data Analysis

## Introduction

This folder contains my work following an excellent exercise on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjpCHNYQodY&) that I thought was a superb interoduction to using Python with some very basic software engineering practices.

## Background

All the data is imported from the web using an interesting data access approach. Basically, a small function in a library was created. I want to use this capability going forward. This exercise will form the basis of my software architecture going forward.

## Analysis

### Objective

We are going to analyze bike traffic data on the Fremont bridge in order to find patterns.

### Method

Simple graphical analysis.
